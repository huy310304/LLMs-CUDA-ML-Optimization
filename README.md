### Research Focus: Compare the performance of a PyTorch machine learning model and a CUDA machine learning model generated using LLMs (Large Language Models). The goal is to evaluate the optimization capabilities of LLMs in generating CUDA code for machine learning tasks, identify any limitations, and determine areas for improvement.

### Phase 1: Learning CUDA and Optimization Techniques
Objective: Learn the fundamentals of CUDA programming, implement simple CUDA applications, and use profiling tools to analyze and optimize these applications.
